## Some notes  
Since this project is still in an experimental phase, I highly recommend that you back up your `segatools.ini` before starting to use this front end.

## About the profile system
By default, profiles created in the graphical interface are saved in `%appdata%`. If you want the profile files to be stored locally, create a text file named `portable.txt` in the program's directory. This will make profiles save in the same folder as the application.
